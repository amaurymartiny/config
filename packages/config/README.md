# `@amaurymartiny/config`

Mostly common-sense configuration files for my projects.

`@amaurymartiny/config` serves as bundle package for the following smaller packages:

- `@amaurymartiny/eslintrc`
- `@amaurymartiny/tsconfig`

So you can either add `@amaurymartiny/config` as a whole, and pick the smaller parts that you want; or you can install the smaller parts individually.

## Get Started

Install the package

```bash
yarn add --dev @amaurymartiny/config
```

And follow the Get Started guides of the following configs:
